# Testing

* The DPLL solver is tested tested end-to-end using example CNF inputs.
    - Test coverage of the DPLL solver is 100%.  

* The CNF parser is tested using example inputs and outputs

* Sudoku parser and Sudoku => CNF converter are tested with unit tests


In addition to these, there are additional tests which test solving a sudoku end-to-end and verify that it's solved correctly


Tests can be repeated by running `npm test`, and the coverage report can be generated by running `coverage.sh` (coverage reports only work when ran on linux)


Test coverage doesn't yet exist for TypeScript tests (Sudoku parsing, Sudoku => CNF conversion, CNF parsing)
