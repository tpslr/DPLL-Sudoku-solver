# Testing

Test coverage of the DPLL solver is 100%.  
However the current tests aren't very good and don't catch some edge cases caused by what I believe to be race conditions.

Currently only the DPLL solver and CNF parser have tests:
* The DPLL solver is tested as one large unit with input data and expected output data
* The CNF parser is tested in a similar fashion

Tests can be repeated by running `npm test`, and the coverage report can be generated by running `coverage.sh` (coverage reports only work when ran on linux)
