# Week 1 report

## Progress
I have set up the git repo, created basic project configuration and installed the required dependancies to compile C++ code into a NodeJS native module.
I have made sure basic code compiles and created the code files for TypeScript/ESModule bindings to use the native module in TS code.

## Learning
I have refreshed my memory on creating NodeJS native modules and C++ syntax.  
After some initial trouble with unclear documentation I figured out which dependacies are required for compiling NodeJS native modules.

## Next
I will begin work on the DPLL solver and get it to a state where it works on test input.

## Time spent this week
Approximately 2 hours
